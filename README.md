# Music-Weather-App
A weather app which suggests music according the weather of the user's location.

Spotify says that sunny days “typically bring higher-energy, happier-sounding music — songs that feel fast, loud and noisy, with more ‘action,’ as well as happy, cheerful, euphoric emotions associated with the major mode and other musical factors,” while rainy days “bring lower-energy, sadder-sounding music with more acoustic vs. electronic sounds”. Last, snowy days call for people streaming “more instrumental music”.
